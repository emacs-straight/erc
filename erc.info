1 Introduction
**************

ERC is a powerful, modular, and extensible IRC client for Emacs.  It has
been included in Emacs since 2006 (*note History::) and is also
available on GNU ELPA.

   IRC is short for Internet Relay Chat.  When using IRC, you can
communicate with other users on the same IRC network.  There are many
different networks—if you search for “IRC networks” in your favorite
search engine, you will find up-to-date lists of IRC networks catering
to various interests and topics.

   To use IRC, you need an IRC client such as ERC. Using the client, you
connect to an IRC server.  Once you’ve done that, you will have access
to all available channels on that server’s network.  A channel is
basically a chat room, and what you type in a channel will be shown to
all other users in that channel.  You can be in several channels at the
same time—ERC will show each channel in its own buffer.

   IRC channel names always begin with a ‘#’ character.  For example,
the Emacs channel on Libera.Chat is ‘#emacs’, and the ERC channel is
‘#erc’.  Do not confuse them with the hashtags used on many social media
platforms.

   You can also send private messages to other IRC users on the same
network, even if they are not in the same channels as you.

   ERC comes with the following capabilities enabled by default.

   • Flood control
   • Timestamps
   • Join channels automatically
   • Buttonize URLs, nicknames, and other text
   • Wrap long lines
   • Highlight or remove IRC control characters
   • Highlight pals, fools, and other keywords
   • Detect netsplits
   • Complete nicknames and commands in a programmable fashion
   • Make displayed lines read-only
   • Input history
   • Track channel activity in the mode-line

2 Getting Started
*****************

The command ‘M-x erc’ will start ERC and prompt for the server to
connect to.  If you’re unsure of which server or network to connect to,
we suggest starting with “irc.libera.chat”.  There you will find the
‘#emacs’ channels where you can chat with other Emacs users, and if
you’re having trouble with ERC, you can join the ‘#erc’ channel and ask
for help there.

   At some point in your ERC journey, you’ll inevitably want to change
how the client looks and behaves.  As with other Emacs applications, the
typical place to store your settings is your ‘init.el’.  If you would
rather use the Customize interface, a good place to start is by running
‘M-x customize-group <RET> erc <RET>’.  In particular, ERC comes with
lots of modules that may be enabled or disabled; to select which ones
you want, do ‘M-x customize-variable <RET> erc-modules <RET>’.

File: docID5oTy.info,  Node: Sample Session,  Next: Special Features,  Up: Getting Started

2.1 Sample Session
==================

This example ERC session describes how to connect to the ‘#emacs’
channel on Libera.Chat.  Also worth checking out is Libera’s own
introductory guide to IRC, <https://libera.chat/guides/basics>, which
presents a more comprehensive overview without instructions specific to
ERC.

   • Connect to Libera.Chat

     Run ‘M-x erc <RET>’.  Use ‘irc.libera.chat’ for the server and
     ‘6667’ for the port.  Choose a nickname, and hit <y> when asked if
     you’d prefer to connect over TLS.

   • Get used to the interface

     Switch to the ‘Libera.Chat’ buffer if you’re not already there.
     ERC calls this a “server buffer”, and it must exist for the
     duration of the session.  You will likely see some messages about
     “ident”, authentication, and the like, followed by information
     describing the current server and the network.

   • Join the #emacs channel

     In the server buffer, type ‘/join #emacs <RET>’ at the prompt.  ERC
     will create a new buffer called ‘#emacs’.  If you’ve already
     configured ERC, you may need to switch to it manually.  Once there,
     you will see the channel’s “topic” in the buffer’s header line
     (*note (elisp)Header Lines::) and a list of people currently in the
     channel.  If you can’t see the full topic, mouse over it or type
     ‘/topic <RET>’ at the prompt.

   • Register your nickname with Libera.Chat

     In order to access essential network features, like speaking in
     certain channels and participating in private conversations, you’ll
     likely have to “register” your nickname.  To do so, switch to the
     ‘Libera.Chat’ buffer and type ‘/msg NickServ register ‘<password>’
     ‘<email>’ <RET>’, replacing ‘<password>’ and ‘<email>’ with your
     desired account password and contact email (both sans quotes).  The
     server should tell you that the operation was successful.  See the
     official Libera.Chat docs if you encounter problems.

     In addition to creating an account, this process also
     “authenticates” you to the network’s “account services” system for
     the duration of the session.  In other words, you’re now logged in.
     However, when you connect in the future, you’ll need to
     authenticate again by providing the same credentials somehow.  When
     you’re finished with this walk through, see “Next Steps”, below, to
     learn some ways to do that.

   • Talk to people in the channel

     Switch back to the ‘#emacs’ buffer and type a message at the
     prompt, hitting ‘RET’ once satisfied.  Everyone in the channel will
     now see your message.

   • Open a query buffer to talk to someone

     If you want to talk with someone in private, type ‘/query ‘<nick>’
     <RET>’, replacing ‘<nick>’ with the their nickname.  As before,
     with the server buffer, if this new “query buffer” doesn’t appear
     in the current window, you may have to switch to it.  Regardless,
     its name should match ‘<nick>’.  Once there, type something at the
     prompt and hit ‘RET’, and the other party will see it.

     Keep in mind that if either party isn’t authenticated, you may not
     be able to converse at all.  Also, depending on the network,
     certain social conventions may apply to the practice of direct
     messaging.  As a general rule, queries should usually be reserved
     for personal matters rather than technical help, which can often
     benefit (and benefit _from_) a larger audience.

   • Next steps

     Try joining another channel, such as ‘#erc’, where ERC users and
     developers hang out (*note Official IRC channels:: for more on the
     history of ‘#emacs’).  For ideas on various options to customize,
     *note Sample Configuration::.  To learn how ERC can authenticate
     you to the network automatically whenever you connect, *note
     SASL::.  As always, if you encounter problems, *note Getting Help
     and Reporting Bugs::.

2.2 Special Features
====================

ERC has some features that distinguish it from some IRC clients.

   • multiple channels and multiple servers

     Every channel is put in a separate buffer.  Several IRC servers may
     be connected to at the same time.

   • private message separation

     Private conversations are treated as channels, and are put into
     separate buffers in Emacs.  We call these “query buffers”.

   • highlighting

     Some occurrences of words can be highlighted, which makes it easier
     to track different kinds of conversations.

   • notification

     ERC can notify you that certain users are online.

   • channel tracking

     Channels can be hidden and conversation continue in the background.
     You are notified when something is said in such a channel that is
     not currently visible.  This makes it easy to get Real Work done
     while still maintaining an IRC presence.

   • nick completion

     ERC can complete words upon hitting ‘TAB’, which eases the writing
     of nicknames in messages.

   • history

     Past actions are kept in history rings for future use.  To navigate
     a history ring, hit ‘M-p’ to go backwards and ‘M-n’ to go forwards.

   • multiple languages

     Different channels and servers may have different language
     encodings.

     multiple languages.  Please contact the Emacs developers if you are
     interested in helping with the translation effort.

   • user scripting

     Users can load scripts (e.g., auto greeting scripts) when ERC
     starts up.

     It is also possible to make custom IRC commands, if you know a
     little Emacs Lisp.  Just make an Emacs Lisp function and call it
     ‘erc-cmd-NEWCOMMAND’, where ‘NEWCOMMAND’ is the name of the new
     command in capital letters.

   • auto reconnect

     If the connection goes away at some point, ERC will try to
     reconnect automatically.  If it fails to reconnect, and you want to
     try to manually reestablish the connection at some later point,
     switch to an ERC buffer and run the ‘/RECONNECT’ command.

4 Modules
*********

One way to add functionality to ERC is to customize which of its many
modules are loaded.

   There is a spiffy customize interface, which may be reached by typing
‘M-x customize-option <RET> erc-modules <RET>’.  When removing a module
outside of Customize, you may wish to ensure it’s disabled by invoking
its associated minor-mode toggle with a nonpositive prefix argument, for
example, ‘C-u - M-x erc-spelling-mode <RET>’.  Additionally, if you plan
on loading third-party modules that perform atypical setup on
activation, you may need to arrange for calling ‘erc-update-modules’ in
your init file.  Examples of such setup might include registering an
‘erc-before-connect’ hook, advising ‘erc-open’, and modifying
‘erc-modules’ itself.  On Emacs 29 and greater, you can also run
‘erc-update-modules’ indirectly, via ‘(setopt erc-modules erc-modules)’.

   The following is a list of available modules.

‘autoaway’

Auxiliary Modules
-----------------

For various reasons, the following modules aren’t currently listed in
the Custom interface for ‘erc-modules’, but feel free to add them
explicitly.  They may be managed by another module or considered more
useful when toggled interactively or just deemed experimental.

‘fill-wrap’
     Wrap long lines using ‘visual-line-mode’

‘keep-place-indicator’
     Remember your place in buffers with a visible reminder; activated
     interactively or via something like ‘erc-join-hook’

‘services-regain’
     Automatically ask NickServ to reclaim your nick when reconnecting;
     experimental as of ERC 5.6

Required Modules
----------------

Note that some modules are essential to core IRC operations and thus not
listed above.  You can nevertheless still remove these, but doing so
demands special precautions to avoid degrading the user experience.  At
present, the only such module is ‘networks’, whose library ERC always
loads anyway.

Local Modules
-------------

All modules operate as minor modes under the hood, and some newer ones
may be defined as buffer-local.  These so-called “local modules” are a
work in progress and their behavior and interface are subject to change.
As of ERC 5.5, the only practical differences are as follows:

  1. “Control variables,” like ‘erc-sasl-mode’, retain their values
     across IRC sessions and override ‘erc-module’ membership when
     influencing module activation.
  2. Removing a local module from ‘erc-modules’ via Customize not only
     disables its mode but also kills its control variable in all ERC
     buffers.
  3. “Mode toggles,” like ‘erc-sasl-mode’ and the complementary
     ‘erc-sasl-enable’/‘erc-sasl-disable’ pairing, behave differently
     than their global counterparts.

   In target buffers, a local module’s activation state survives
“reassociation” by default, but modules themselves always have the final
say.  For example, a module may reset all instances of itself in its
network context upon reconnecting.  Moreover, the value of a mode
variable may be meaningless in buffers that its module has no interest
in.  For example, the value of ‘erc-sasl-mode’ doesn’t matter in target
buffers and may even remain non-‘nil’ after SASL has been disabled for
the current connection (and vice versa).

   When it comes to server buffers, a module’s activation state only
persists for sessions revived via the automatic reconnection mechanism
or a manual ‘/reconnect’ issued at the prompt.  In other words, this
doesn’t apply to sessions revived by an entry-point command, such as
‘erc-tls’, because such commands always ensure a clean slate by looking
only to ‘erc-modules’.  Although a session revived in this manner may
indeed harvest other information from a previous server buffer, it
simply doesn’t care which modules might have been active during that
connection.

   Lastly, a local mode’s toggle command, like ‘erc-sasl-mode’, only
affects the current buffer, but its “non-mode” cousins, like
‘erc-sasl-enable’ and ‘erc-sasl-disable’, operate on all buffers
belonging to their connection (when called interactively).  And unlike
global toggles, none of these ever mutates ‘erc-modules’.

Loading
-------

ERC loads internal modules in alphabetical order and third-party modules
as they appear in ‘erc-modules’.  When defining your own module, take
care to ensure ERC can find it.  An easy way to do that is by mimicking
the example in the doc string for ‘define-erc-module’ (also shown
below).  For historical reasons, ERC falls back to ‘require’ing
features.  For example, if some module ‘my-module’ in ‘erc-modules’
lacks a corresponding ‘erc-my-module-mode’ command, ERC will attempt to
load the library ‘erc-my-module’ prior to connecting.  If this fails,
ERC signals an error.  Users defining personal modules in an init file
should ‘(provide 'erc-my-module)’ somewhere to placate ERC. Dynamically
generating modules on the fly is not supported.

   Some older built-in modules have a second name along with a second
minor-mode toggle, which is just a function alias for its primary
counterpart.  For practical reasons, ERC does not define a corresponding
variable alias because contending with indirect variables complicates
bookkeeping tasks, such as persisting module state across IRC sessions.
New modules should definitely avoid defining aliases without a good
reason.

   Some packages have been known to autoload a module’s definition
instead of its minor-mode command, which severs the link between the
library and the module.  This means that enabling the mode by invoking
its command toggle isn’t enough to load its defining library.  As such,
packages should only supply module-related autoload cookies with an
actual ‘autoload’ form for their module’s minor-mode command, like so:

     ;;;###autoload(autoload 'erc-my-module-mode "erc-my-module" nil t)
     (define-erc-module my-module nil
       "My doc string."
       ((add-hook 'erc-insert-post-hook #'erc-my-module-on-insert-post))
       ((remove-hook 'erc-insert-post-hook #'erc-my-module-on-insert-post)))

As implied earlier, packages can usually omit such cookies entirely so
long as their module’s prefixed name matches that of its defining
library and the library’s provided feature.

   Finally, packages have also been observed to run ‘erc-update-modules’
in top-level forms, forcing ERC to take special precautions to avoid
recursive invocations.  Another unfortunate practice is mutating
‘erc-modules’ itself upon loading ‘erc’, possibly by way of an autoload.
Doing this tricks Customize into displaying the widget for ‘erc-modules’
incorrectly, with built-in modules moved from the predefined checklist
to the user-provided free-form area.

5.1 Connecting to an IRC Server
===============================

The easiest way to connect to an IRC server is to call ‘M-x erc’.  If
you want to assign this function to a keystroke, the following will help
you figure out its parameters.

 -- Function: erc
     Select connection parameters and run ERC.  Non-interactively, it
     takes the following keyword arguments.

        • SERVER
        • PORT
        • NICK
        • USER
        • PASSWORD
        • FULL-NAME
        • ID

     For example, calling the command like so

          (erc :server "irc.libera.chat" :full-name "J. Random Hacker")

     sets SERVER and FULL-NAME directly while leaving the rest up to
     functions like ‘erc-compute-port’.  Note that some arguments can’t
     be specified interactively.  ID, in particular, is rarely needed
     (*note Network Identifier::).

To connect securely over an encrypted TLS connection, use ‘M-x erc-tls’.

 -- Function: erc-tls
     Select connection parameters and run ERC over TLS.
     Non-interactively, it takes the following keyword arguments.

        • SERVER
        • PORT
        • NICK
        • USER
        • PASSWORD
        • FULL-NAME
        • ID
        • CLIENT-CERTIFICATE

     That is, if called in the following manner

          (erc-tls :server "irc.libera.chat" :full-name "J. Random Hacker")

     the command will set SERVER and FULL-NAME accordingly, while
     helpers, like ‘erc-compute-nick’, will determine other parameters,
     and some, like ‘client-certificate’, will just be ‘nil’.

     To use a certificate with ‘erc-tls’, specify the optional
     CLIENT-CERTIFICATE keyword argument, whose value should be as
     described in the documentation of ‘open-network-stream’: if
     non-‘nil’, it should either be a list where the first element is
     the file name of the private key corresponding to a client
     certificate and the second element is the file name of the client
     certificate itself to use when connecting over TLS, or ‘t’, which
     means that ‘auth-source’ will be queried for the private key and
     the certificate.  Authenticating using a TLS client certificate is
     also referred to as “CertFP” (Certificate Fingerprint)
     authentication by various IRC networks.

     Examples of use:

          (erc-tls :server "irc.libera.chat" :port 6697
                   :client-certificate
                   '("/home/bandali/my-cert.key"
                     "/home/bandali/my-cert.crt"))

          (erc-tls :server "irc.libera.chat" :port 6697
                   :client-certificate
                   `(,(expand-file-name "~/cert-libera.key")
                     ,(expand-file-name "~/cert-libera.crt")))

          (erc-tls :server "irc.libera.chat" :port 6697
                   :client-certificate t)

     In the case of ‘:client-certificate t’, you will need to add a line
     like the following to your authinfo file (e.g.  ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’):

          machine irc.libera.chat key /home/bandali/my-cert.key cert /home/bandali/my-cert.crt

     ERC, *note ERC’s auth-source integration: auth-source.

Server
------

 -- Function: erc-compute-server &optional server
     Return an IRC server name.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-‘nil’ value is found.

        • SERVER (the argument passed to this function)
        • The ‘erc-server’ option
        • The value of the IRCSERVER environment variable
        • The ‘erc-default-server’ variable

 -- User Option: erc-server
     IRC server to use if one is not provided.

Port
----

 -- Function: erc-compute-port &optional port
     Return a port for an IRC server.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-‘nil’ value is found.

        • PORT (the argument passed to this function)
        • The ‘erc-port’ option
        • The ‘erc-default-port’ variable

 -- User Option: erc-port
     IRC port to use if not specified.

     This can be either a string or a number.

Nick
----

 -- Function: erc-compute-nick &optional nick
     Return user’s IRC nick.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-‘nil’ value is found.

        • NICK (the argument passed to this function)
        • The ‘erc-nick’ option
        • The value of the IRCNICK environment variable
        • The result from the ‘user-login-name’ function

 -- User Option: erc-nick
     Nickname to use if one is not provided.

     This can be either a string, or a list of strings.  In the latter
     case, if the first nick in the list is already in use, other nicks
     are tried in the list order.

 -- User Option: erc-show-speaker-membership-status
     A boolean for including a channel member’s “status prefix” in their
     display name when they speak.

 -- User Option: erc-nick-uniquifier
     The string to append to the nick if it is already in use.

 -- User Option: erc-try-new-nick-p
     If the nickname you chose isn’t available, and this option is
     non-‘nil’, ERC should automatically attempt to connect with another
     nickname.

     You can manually set another nickname with the /NICK command.

User
----

 -- Function: erc-compute-user &optional user
     Determine a suitable value to send as the first argument of the
     opening ‘USER’ IRC command by consulting the following sources:

        • USER, the argument passed to this function
        • The option ‘erc-email-userid’, assuming ‘erc-anonymous-login’
          is non-‘nil’
        • The result of calling the function ‘user-login-name’

 -- User Option: erc-email-userid
     A permanent username value to send for all connections.  It should
     be a string abiding by the rules of the network.

Password
--------

This parameter was traditionally meant to specify a “server password” to
be sent along with the IRC ‘PASS’ command.  However, such passwords
aren’t widely used.  Instead, networks typically expect them, when
present, to convey other authentication information.  In the case of
account-services (a.k.a., “NickServ”) credentials, this typically
involves a special syntax, such as ‘myuser:mypass’.  IRC bouncers often
do something similar but include a pre-configured network-ID component,
for example, ‘bncuser/mynet:bncpass’.

   In general, if you have _not_ been asked by your network or bouncer
to specify a repurposed server password, you should instead consider
setting up ‘services’ or, preferably, ‘sasl’, both ERC modules (*note
Modules::).  In addition to performing network-account authentication,
these obviate the need for this parameter completely, although both can
optionally borrow it for their own purposes.  (*Note SASL in ERC: SASL.)

 -- User Option: erc-prompt-for-password
     If non-‘nil’ (the default), ‘M-x erc’ and ‘M-x erc-tls’ prompt for
     a server password.  This only affects interactive invocations of
     ‘erc’ and ‘erc-tls’.

If you prefer, you can set this option to ‘nil’ and use the auth-source
facility to retrieve a server password, although hitting ‘RET’ at the
prompt may achieve the same effect.  *Note ERC’s auth-source
integration: auth-source, for more.

Full name
---------

 -- Function: erc-compute-full-name &optional full-name
     Return user’s full name.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-‘nil’ value is found.

        • FULL-NAME (the argument passed to this function)
        • The ‘erc-user-full-name’ option
        • The value of the IRCNAME environment variable
        • The result from the ‘user-full-name’ function

 -- User Option: erc-user-full-name
     User full name.

     This can be either a string or a function to call.

ID
--

ERC uses an abstract designation, called “network context identifier”,
for referring to a connection internally.  While normally derived from a
combination of logical and physical connection parameters, an ID can
also be explicitly provided via an entry-point command (like ‘erc-tls’).
Use this in rare situations where ERC would otherwise have trouble
discerning between connections.

   One such situation might arise when using multiple connections to the
same network with the same nick but different (nonstandard) ‘device’
identifiers, which some bouncers may support.  Another might be when
mimicking the experience offered by popular standalone clients, which
normally offer “named” persistent configurations with server buffers
reflecting those names.  Yet another use case might involve third-party
code needing to identify a connection unequivocally, but in a
human-friendly way suitable for UI components.

   When providing an ID as an entry-point argument, strings and symbols
make the most sense, but any reasonably printable object is acceptable.

5.2 Authenticating via SASL
===========================

If you’ve used SASL elsewhere, you can probably skip to the examples
below.  Otherwise, if you haven’t already registered with your network,
please do so now, referring to the network’s own instructions for
details.  If you’re new to IRC and using a bouncer, know that you
probably won’t be needing this for the client-to-bouncer connection.

   When you’re ready to get started, add ‘sasl’ to ‘erc-modules’, like
you would any other module.  If unsure which “mechanism” to choose,
stick with the default of ‘PLAIN’.  Then try ‘C-u M-x erc-tls <RET>’,
and give your account name for the ‘user’ parameter and your account
password for the ‘server password’.

 -- User Option: erc-sasl-mechanism
     The name of an SASL subprotocol type as a _lowercase_ symbol.  The
     value can be one of the following:

     ‘plain’ or ‘scram’ (“password-based”)
          Here, “password” refers to your account password, which is
          usually your ‘NickServ’ password.  To make this work,
          customize ‘erc-sasl-user’ and ‘erc-sasl-password’ or specify
          the ‘:user’ and ‘:password’ keyword arguments when invoking
          ‘erc-tls’.

     ‘external’ (via client TLS certificate)
          This works in conjunction with the ‘:client-certificate’
          keyword offered by ‘erc-tls’.  Just ensure you’ve registered
          your fingerprint with the network beforehand.  The fingerprint
          is usually a SHA1 or SHA256 digest in either "normalized" or
          "openssl" forms.  The first is lowercase without delims
          (‘deadbeef’) and the second uppercase with colon seps
          (‘DE:AD:BE:EF’).  These days, there’s usually a ‘CERT ADD’
          command offered by NickServ that can register you
          automatically if you issue it while connected with a client
          cert.  *Note client-certificate::.

          Additional considerations:
            1. Most IRCds will allow you to authenticate with a client
               cert but without the hassle of SASL (meaning you may not
               need this module).
            2. Technically, EXTERNAL merely indicates that an
               out-of-band mode of authentication is in effect (being
               deferred to), so depending on the specific application or
               service, there’s a remote chance your server has
               something else in mind.

     ‘ecdsa-nist256p-challenge’
          This mechanism is quite complicated and currently requires the
          external ‘openssl’ executable, so please use something else if
          at all possible.  Ignoring that, specify your key file (e.g.,
          ‘~/pki/mykey.pem’) as the value of ‘erc-sasl-password’, and
          then configure your network settings.  On servers running
          Atheme services, you can add your public key with ‘NickServ’
          like so:

               ERC> /msg NickServ set property \
                    pubkey AgGZmlYTUjJlea/BVz7yrjJ6gysiAPaQxzeUzTH4hd5j

          (You may be able to omit the ‘property’ subcommand.)

 -- User Option: erc-sasl-user
     This should be your network account username, typically the same
     one registered with nickname services.  Specify this when your
     NickServ login differs from the ‘:user’ you’re connecting with.
     *Note username parameter::.

 -- User Option: erc-sasl-password
     As noted elsewhere, the entry-point ‘:password’ param was
     originally intended for traditional “server passwords,” but these
     aren’t really used any more (*note password parameter::).  As such,
     this option defaults to borrowing that parameter for its own uses,
     thus allowing you to call ‘erc-tls’ with ‘:password’ set to your
     NickServ password.

     You can also set this to a nonemtpy string, and ERC will send that
     when needed, no questions asked.  Or, if you’d rather use
     auth-source, set ‘erc-sasl-auth-source-function’ to a function, and
     ERC will perform an auth-source query instead.  In all cases, ERC
     will prompt you for input as a last resort.

     Lastly, if your mechanism is ‘ecdsa-nist256p-challenge’, this
     option should instead hold the file name of your key.

 -- User Option: erc-sasl-auth-source-function
     This is nearly identical to the other ERC ‘auth-source’ function
     options (*note auth-source functions::) except that the default
     value here is ‘nil’, meaning you have to set it to something like
     ‘erc-auth-source-search’ for queries to be performed.  For
     convenience, this module provides the following as a possible
     value:

      -- Function: erc-sasl-auth-source-password-as-host &rest plist
          Setting ‘erc-sasl-auth-source-function’ to this function tells
          ERC to use ‘erc-sasl-password’ for the ‘:host’ field when
          querying auth-source, even if its value is the default
          ‘:password’, in which case ERC knows to “resolve” it to
          ‘erc-session-password’ and use that as long as it’s non-‘nil’.
          Otherwise, ERC just defers to ‘erc-auth-source-search’ to
          determine the ‘:host’, along with everything else.

     As long as this option specifies a function, ERC will pass it the
     “resolved” value of ‘erc-sasl-user’ for the auth-source ‘:user’
     param.

 -- User Option: erc-sasl-authzid
     In the rarest of circumstances, a network may want you to specify a
     specific role or assume an alternate identity.  In most cases, this
     happens because the server is buggy or misconfigured.  If you
     suspect such a thing, please contact your network operator.
     Otherwise, just leave this set to ‘nil’.

Examples
--------

   • Defaults

          (erc-tls :server "irc.libera.chat" :port 6697
                   :nick "aph"
                   :user "APHacker"
                   :password "changeme")

     Here, after adding ‘sasl’ to ‘erc-modules’ via the Customize
     interface, you authenticate to Libera.Chat using the ‘PLAIN’
     mechanism and your NickServ credentials, ‘APHacker’ and ‘changeme’.

   • External

          (setopt erc-sasl-mechanism 'external)

          (erc-tls :server "irc.libera.chat" :port 6697 :nick "aph"
                   :client-certificate
                   '("/home/aph/my.key" "/home/aph/my.crt"))

     You decide to switch things up and try out the ‘EXTERNAL’
     mechanism.  You follow your network’s instructions for telling
     NickServ about your client-certificate’s fingerprint, and you
     authenticate successfully.

   • Multiple networks

          # ~/.authinfo.gpg

          machine irc.libera.chat key /home/aph/my.key cert /home/aph/my.crt
          machine Example.Net login alyssa password sEcReT
          machine Example.Net login aph-bot password sesame

          ;; init.el

          (defun my-erc-up (network)
            (interactive "Snetwork: ")
            (require 'erc-sasl)
            (or (let ((erc-modules (cons 'sasl erc-modules)))
                  (pcase network
                    ('libera
                     (let ((erc-sasl-mechanism 'external))
                       (erc-tls :server "irc.libera.chat"
                                :client-certificate t)))
                    ('example
                     (let ((erc-sasl-auth-source-function
                            #'erc-sasl-auth-source-password-as-host))
                       (erc-tls :server "irc.example.net"
                                :user "alyssa"
                                :password "Example.Net")))))
                ;; Non-SASL
                (call-interactively #'erc-tls)))

     You’ve started storing your credentials with auth-source and have
     decided to try SASL on another network as well.  But there’s a
     catch: this network doesn’t support ‘EXTERNAL’.  You use
     ‘let’-binding to work around this and successfully authenticate to
     both networks.  (Note that this example assumes you’ve removed
     ‘sasl’ from ‘erc-modules’ globally and have instead opted to add it
     locally when connecting to preconfigured networks.)

Troubleshooting
---------------

First and foremost, please know that ERC’s SASL offering is currently
limited by a lack of support for proper IRCv3 capability negotiation.
In most cases, this shouldn’t affect your ability to authenticate.

   If you’re struggling, remember that your SASL password is almost
always your NickServ password.  When in doubt, try restoring all SASL
options to their defaults and calling ‘erc-tls’ with ‘:user’ set to your
NickServ account name and ‘:password’ to your NickServ password.  If
you’re still having trouble, please contact us (*note Getting Help and
Reporting Bugs::).

   As you try out different settings, keep in mind that it’s best to
create a fresh session for every change, for example, by calling
‘erc-tls’ from scratch.  More experienced users may be able to get away
with cycling ‘erc-sasl-mode’ and issuing a ‘/reconnect’, but that’s
generally not recommended.  Whatever the case, you’ll probably want to
temporarily disable ‘erc-server-auto-reconnect’ while experimenting.

5.3 Sample Configuration
========================

Here is an example configuration for ERC.  *Don’t panic* if you aren’t
familiar with ‘use-package’ or have no interest in learning it.  For our
purposes, it’s just a means of presenting configuration details in a
tidy, standardized format.  If it helps, just pretend it’s some
make-believe, pseudo configuration language.  And while the syntax below
is easy enough to intuit and adapt to your setup, you may wish to keep
the following in mind:

   • Each ‘use-package’ “declaration” focuses on a library “feature”,
     which is just a symbol you’d normally ‘require’ in your config.

   • Emacs loads anything in a ‘:config’ section _after_ loading
     whatever library ‘provide’s the declaration’s feature.

   • Everything in a ‘:custom’ or ‘:custom-face’ section is basically
     something you’d find in your ‘custom-file’.

   • For more info, *note (elisp)Named Features::, or *note
     (use-package)Top::.

The following would typically go in your init file.  Experienced users
may opt to keep any non-settings, like commands and functions, in a
dedicated ‘~/.emacs.d/.ercrc.el’.  Whatever the case, please keep in
mind that you can replace nearly all of the following with Custom
settings (*note Sample configuration via Customize::).

     ;;; My ERC configuration -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

       ;; Emphasize buttonized text in notices.
       :custom-face (erc-notice-face ((t (:slant italic :weight unspecified)))))

     (use-package erc-sasl
       ;; Since my account name is the same as my nick, free me from having
       ;; to hit C-u before M-x erc to trigger a username prompt.

       :config (setopt erc-track-faces-priority-list
                       (remq 'erc-notice-face erc-track-faces-priority-list))

       :custom (erc-track-priority-faces-only 'all))

     (use-package erc-goodies
       ;; Turn on read indicators when joining channels.
       :hook (erc-join . my-erc-enable-keep-place-indicator-on-join))

     (defvar my-erc-read-indicator-channels '("#emacs")
       "Channels in which to show a `keep-place-indicator'.")

     (defun my-erc-enable-keep-place-indicator-on-join ()
       "Enable read indicators for certain queries or channels."
       (when (member (erc-default-target) my-erc-read-indicator-channels)
         (erc-keep-place-indicator-mode +1)))

     ;; Handy commands from the Emacs Wiki.
     (defun erc-cmd-TRACK (&optional target)
       "Start tracking TARGET or that of current buffer."
       (setq erc-track-exclude
             (delete (or target (erc-default-target) (current-buffer))
                     erc-track-exclude)))

     (defun erc-cmd-UNTRACK (&optional target)
       "Stop tracking TARGET or that of current buffer."
       (setq erc-track-exclude
             (cl-pushnew (or target (erc-default-target) (current-buffer))
                         erc-track-exclude
                         :test #'equal)))


Those familiar with ‘use-package’ may have noticed the lack of ‘:defer’
keyword args.  This was done to conserve space, but you can just pretend
that this user has enabled ‘use-package-always-defer’ elsewhere.

Via Customize
-------------

As mentioned, Customize users can accomplish nearly all of the above via
the Customize interface.  Start by running ‘M-x customize-group <RET>
erc <RET>’, and search for “Modules” with ‘C-s modules <RET>’.  Toggle
open the flyout menu to reveal the full “widget” panel, a web-form-like
interface for “Erc Modules”.  Tick the boxes for ‘bufbar’, ‘nickbar’,
‘nicks’, ‘sasl’, and ‘scrolltobottom’.

   Next, search for the phrases “Erc Ask About Multiline Input”, “Erc
Inhibit Multiline Input”, and “Erc Send Whitespace Lines”.  These are
the print names of three boolean options that control how ERC treats
prompt input containing line breaks.  When visiting each option’s
section, twirl open its triangle icon to reveal its widget UI, and click
its ‘[Toggle]’ button to set its value to ‘t’.  While going about this,
you may find it helpful to glance at the descriptions just in case you
want to disable them later.  When finished, hit ‘C-x C-s’ or click
‘[Apply and Save]’ atop the buffer.

   Now do the same for another couple options, this time having to do
with automatic reconnection.  But instead of searching for their print
names, try running ‘M-x customize-option <RET> ‘<option>’ <RET>’,
replacing ‘<option>’ with:

   • ‘erc-server-reconnect-function’, a function
   • ‘erc-server-reconnect-timeout’, a number

(If it helps, hit <TAB> for completion.)  As you may have noticed, when
customizing options individually, each buffer displays but a single
option’s widget.  When you get to the buffer for “Erc Server Reconnect
Function”, you’ll see that ‘[Toggle]’ has been replaced with ‘[Value
Menu]’ and that clicking it reveals three choices in a pop-up window.
Enter ‘1’ to select ‘erc-server-delayed-check-reconnect’ before
<TAB>’ing over to ‘[State]’ and hitting <RET>.  Enter ‘1’ again, this
time to persists your changes.

   For the final option, ‘erc-server-reconnect-timeout’, you’ll
encounter a text field (instead of a button), which works like those in
a typical web form.  Enter ‘30’ and hit ‘C-x C-s’ to save.  Just for
fun, click the group link for ‘Erc Server’ at the bottom of the buffer.
You could just as well have set the last two options from this “custom
group” buffer alone, which very much resembles the one for the ‘Erc’
group, which is actually the “parent” of this group (note the
“breadcrumb” for group ‘Erc’ atop the buffer).  Indeed, you can always
get back here by running ‘M-x customize-group <RET> erc-server <RET>’
from almost anywhere in Emacs.

   To make sure you’ve got this, try quickly customizing the option
‘erc-interactive-display’, which lives in the ‘Erc Buffers’ group (‘M-x
customize-group <RET> erc-buffers <RET>’).  As its doc string explains,
the option controls where new buffers show up when you do ‘M-x erc-tls
<RET>’ or issue certain “slash commands”, like ‘/JOIN #emacs-beginners
<RET>’, at ERC’s prompt.  Change its value to the symbol ‘buffer’ by
choosing ‘Use current window’ (item ‘5’) from the option’s ‘[Value
Menu]’.  Don’t forget to save.

   If you need more practice, try enabling the boolean option
‘erc-scrolltobottom-all’, which lives in the ‘Erc Display’ group (‘M-x
customize-group <RET> erc-display <RET>’).  When enabled, this option
tells the ‘scrolltobottom’ module to adjust all ERC windows instead of
just the one you’re currently typing in.

   Now it’s time to set some key bindings for ‘erc-mode-map’, a
major-mode keymap active in all ERC buffers.  In general, it’s best to
do this part either entirely or in conjunction with some lisp code in
you init file.  However, to keep things “simple”, we’ll do it all in
customization buffers.  To get started, hit ‘M-x customize-group <RET>
erc-hooks <RET>’ and search for “Erc Mode Hook”.  In the widget form,
click ‘[INS]’, and paste the following into the value field in place of
the default text.

     (lambda ()
       (keymap-set erc-mode-map "RET" nil)
       (keymap-set erc-mode-map "C-c C-c" 'erc-send-current-line))

Don’t worry about the line breaks.  Emacs is smart enough to handle
those.  When you’re ready, click ‘[Apply and Save]’.

   Next, try tweaking the face ERC uses to stylize server messages that
say things like “SoAndSo has joined channel #chan”.  Type ‘M-x
customize-face <RET> erc-notice-face <RET>’.  Click the “link”-looking
button at the very bottom that says something like “Show All
Attributes”.  Untick ‘Weight’ and tick ‘Slant’.  Then, in the latter’s
‘[Value Menu]’, enter ‘0’ for ‘italic’.  Hit ‘C-x C-s’ to save.

   Time for some more involved configuring.  From now on, if something
isn’t applicable to your setup, just skip ahead.  Also, note that if
you’ve installed ERC from GNU ELPA, you may need to load libraries for
groups and options you’d like to customize before Emacs can create a
customization buffer.  For example, to do this for the group ‘erc-sasl’,
run ‘M-: (require 'erc-sasl) <RET>’.

   Speaking of SASL, those already authenticating with it may have
noticed that connecting interactively requires running ‘C-u M-x erc-tls
<RET>’ in order to receive a “User” prompt for your account name.
However, if your nickname happens to be the same as your account name,
you can avoid the leading ‘C-u’ by customizing the option
‘erc-sasl-user’ to the keyword symbol ‘:nick’.  At the time of writing,
you’d hit ‘2’ when prompted by the option’s ‘[Value menu]’.  Hit ‘C-x
C-s’ to save your changes.

   One of ERC’s most configured options lives in ‘erc-join’, and it
determines the channels you join upon connecting.  To make it work for
you, customize the option ‘erc-autojoin-channels-alist’.  In the
customization widget, hit ‘[INS]’ to create a new entry.  In the
‘Network:’ field, type ‘Libera.Chat’.  Under ‘Channels:’, hit ‘[INS]’
again, this time to create a field to enter a channel name, and enter
‘#emacs’.  Now, find and click on the lowermost ‘[INS]’, and this time
enter ‘#erc’ in the ‘Name:’ field.  Save your changes.

   If you’re new to ERC, you may not be familiar with the various ways
it can “fill” message text by inserting line breaks.  The most modern
fill style is called ‘fill-wrap’, and it’s available by customizing
‘erc-fill-function’ to ‘erc-fill-wrap’, which appears as ‘Dynamic
word-wrap’ in the option’s ‘[Value Menu]’.  After setting this, change
the related option ‘erc-fill-static-center’ to the integer ‘18’.  Save
your changes.  As a bonus exercise, try binding the key ‘C-c =’ to the
function ‘erc-fill-wrap-nudge’ in the minor-mode keymap
‘erc-fill-wrap-mode-map’ (hint: the minor mode’s hook is called
‘erc-fill-wrap-mode-hook’, and it’s not a member of any customization
group).

   ERC users tend to be picky about the mode line.  If you find that
you’d rather not see changes when people join and leave channels,
customize the option ‘erc-track-faces-priority-list’.  When visiting its
customization buffer, you’ll notice it’s quite busy.  Ignore everything
and type ‘C-s erc-notice-face <RET>’.  Click the ‘[DEL]’ button at the
beginning of the line you end up on, and save your changes.  Next,
customize the related option ‘erc-track-priority-faces-only’ to the
‘[Value Menu]’ choice ‘all’.  Once again, save your changes.

   Let’s say you’d like to enable a “local module” (ERC’s version of a
local minor mode) in a specific channel.  One way to do that is by
running some code to activate the module if the channel’s name matches.
Try that now by customizing the option ‘erc-join-hook’.  Add the
following in the value field before saving your changes:

     (lambda ()
       (require 'erc-goodies)
       (when (equal (erc-default-target) "#emacs")
         (erc-keep-place-indicator-mode +1)))

   Lastly, if you really want the two “slash commands” defined at the
end of the previous section, you can put them in any file listed in
‘erc-startup-file-list’, such as ‘~/.emacs.d/.ercrc.el’.  Make sure to
put ‘(require 'erc-track)’ near the top of the file.  These will allow
you to type ‘/TRACK <RET>’ and ‘/UNTRACK <RET>’ in channels and query
buffers to tell ERC whether to show activity from these buffers in the
mode line.

* Menu:

* auth-source::                 Retrieving auth-source entries with ERC.
* display-buffer::              Controlling how ERC displays buffers.

5.4.1 URL
---------

For anything to work, you’ll want to set ‘url-irc-function’ to
‘url-irc-erc’.  As a rule of thumb, libraries relying directly on
‘url-retrieve’ should be fine out the box from Emacs 29.1 onward.  On
older versions of Emacs, you may need to ‘(require 'erc)’ beforehand.
*Note (url)Retrieving URLs::.

   For other apps and libraries, such as those relying on the
higher-level ‘browse-url’, you’ll oftentimes be asked to specify a
pattern, sometimes paired with a function that accepts a string URL as a
first argument.  For example, with EWW, you may need to tack something
like ‘"\\|\\`irc6?s?:"’ onto the end of ‘eww-use-browse-url’.  But with
‘gnus-button-alist’, you’ll need a function as well:

       '("\\birc6?s?://[][a-z0-9.,@_:+%?&/#-]+" 0 t browse-url-irc 0)

Users on Emacs 28 and below may need to use ‘browse-url’ instead.

5.4.2 SOCKS
-----------

People wanting to connect to IRC through a SOCKS proxy are most likely
interested in doing so over TOR (The Onion Router).  If that’s _not_
you, please adapt these instructions accordingly.  Otherwise, keep in
mind that support for Tor is experimental and thus insufficient for
safeguarding a user’s identity and location, especially in the case of
targeted individuals.

   ERC’s preferred Tor setup works by accessing a local Tor service
through the built-in ‘socks.el’ library that ships with Emacs.  Other
means of accessing Tor, such as via ‘torsocks’, are not supported.
Before getting started, check that your Tor service is up and running.
You can do that with the following command:

     curl --proxy socks5h://localhost:9050 https://check.torproject.org | \
       grep 'Congratulations'

   Networks and servers differ in how they expose Tor endpoints.  In all
cases, you’ll want to first set the option ‘socks-server’ to something
appropriate, like ‘("tor" "127.0.0.1" 9050 5)’.  For some networks,
setting ‘erc-server-connect-function’ to ‘socks-open-network-stream’
might be enough.  Others, like ‘Libera.Chat’, involve additional setup.
At the time of writing, connecting to that network requires both TLS and
a permitted SASL mechanism, like ‘EXTERNAL’ (*note SASL::), as shown in
the following example:

     (require 'erc)
     (require 'socks)

     (defun my-erc-open-socks-tls-stream (&rest args)
       (let ((socks-username "")
             (socks-password "")
             (socks-server '("tor" "localhost" 9050 5)))
         (apply #'erc-open-socks-tls-stream args)))

     (let* ((erc-modules (cons 'sasl erc-modules))
            (erc-sasl-mechanism 'external)
            (erc-server-connect-function #'my-erc-open-socks-tls-stream))
       (erc-tls
        :server "libera75jm6of4wxpxt4aynol3xjmbtxgfyjpu34ss4d7r7q2v5zrpyd.onion"
        :port 6697
        :nick "jrh"
        :user "jrandomhacker"
        :full-name "J. Random Hacker"
        :client-certificate (list "/home/jrh/key.pem" "/home/jrh/cert.pem")))

Here, the user-provided ‘my-erc-open-socks-tls-stream’ ensures that the
preferred values for ‘socks-server’ and friends will be available when
reconnecting.  If you plan on using SOCKS with ERC exclusively, you can
just set those options and variables globally and bind
‘erc-server-connect-function’ to ‘erc-open-socks-tls-stream’ instead.


File: docID5oTy.info,  Node: auth-source,  Next: display-buffer,  Up: Integrations

5.4.3 auth-source
-----------------

You can configure ERC to use the built-in auth-source library for
looking up passwords.  *Note auth-source: (auth)Top, for general info on
setting up various backends, but keep in mind that some of these may not
be compatible.  Those currently supported are netrc, plstore, json,
secrets, and pass.  To get started with the default backend, netrc, put
a line like the following in your ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’ (or any file named
in the option ‘auth-sources’):

     machine irc.example.net login mynick password sEcReT

Server Passwords
................

When retrieving passwords to accompany the IRC ‘PASS’ command (*note
password parameter::), ERC asks auth-source to match the SERVER
parameter of ‘erc-tls’ against each entry’s ‘host’ field
(‘machine irc.example.net’ in the above example).  Unfortunately,
specifying a network, like ‘Libera.Chat’, or a specific network server,
like ‘platinum.libera.chat’, won’t normally work for looking up a server
password because that information isn’t available during opening
introductions.  (Actually, ERC _can_ find entries with arbitrary ‘host’
values for any context, including server passwords, but that requires
customizing the more advanced options below.)

   If ERC can’t find a suitable server password, it will just skip the
IRC ‘PASS’ command altogether, something users may want when using
CertFP or engaging NickServ via ERC’s ‘services’ module.  If that
appeals to you, consider customizing the option
‘erc-auth-source-server-function’ to ‘nil’ to skip server-password
lookup for all servers.  Note that some networks and IRCds may accept
account-services authentication via server password.  Also, some ERC
modules may commandeer the ‘erc-tls’ PASSWORD parameter for their own
ends, which likely don’t involve a server password.

The ‘services’ module
.....................

You can use auth-source to authenticate to account services the
traditional way through a bot called ‘NickServ’.  To do so, add
‘services’ to ‘erc-modules’ and set the option
‘erc-use-auth-source-for-nickserv-password’ to ‘t’.  After that, expect
the ‘user’ parameter in relevant auth-source queries to be your current
nickname.

   Most of the time, a query’s precise contextual details (such as
whether a nick was granted or forcibly assigned) shouldn’t affect how
you define entries in your backend.  However, if something isn’t quite
working, you may want to investigate the interplay between the option
‘erc-nickserv-identify-mode’ and account services.  In particular, if
you find yourself facing nicks suffixed with an ‘erc-nick-uniquifier’
(the infamous ‘`’), check that the network’s entry in
‘erc-nickserv-alist’ is up to date, and do let us know if something’s
off (*note Getting Help and Reporting Bugs::).  Of course, if you’ve had
your fill of fiddling with this module, consider switching to SASL for
what’s likely a more consistent auth-source experience.  (*Note SASL::.)

Default query behavior
......................

When preparing entries for your backend, it may help to get a feel for
how ERC and its modules conduct searches, especially when exploring a
new context, such as channel keys.  Overall, though, ERC tries to be
consistent in performing queries across various authentication contexts.
Here’s what to expect with respect to the ‘host’ field, which, by
default, most heavily influences the fate of a query:

  1. entries featuring custom identifiers and networks are matched first
     (*note Network Identifier::)
  2. followed by network-specific servers
  3. and, finally, dialed endpoints (typically the SERVER argument
     passed to ‘erc-tls’)

The following netrc-style entries appear in order of precedence:

     machine Libera/cellphone login MyNick password sEcReT
     machine Libera.Chat login MyNick password sEcReT
     machine zirconium.libera.chat login MyNick password sEcReT
     machine irc.libera.chat login MyNick password sEcReT

Remember that field labels vary per backend, so ‘machine’ (in netrc’s
case) maps to auth-source’s generalized notion of a host, hence the
‘:host’ keyword parameter to ‘auth-source-search’.  Also, be sure to
mind the syntax of your chosen backend medium.  For example, always
quote channel names in a netrc file.

   Lastly, if this all seems overly nuanced or just plain doesn’t appeal
to you, please see options ‘erc-auth-source-services-function’ and
friends, described just below.

Custom query functions
......................

These let you query auth-source your way.  Most users can simply ignore
the passed-in arguments and get by with something like the following:

     (defun my-fancy-auth-source-func (&rest _)
       (let* ((host (read-string "host: " nil nil "default"))
              (pass (auth-source-pick-first-password :host host)))
         (if (and pass (string-search "libera" host))
             (concat "MyNick:" pass)
           pass)))

 -- User Option: erc-auth-source-server-function
 -- User Option: erc-auth-source-services-function
 -- User Option: erc-auth-source-join-function

     ERC calls these functions with keyword arguments recognized by
     ‘auth-source-search’, namely, those deemed most relevant to the
     current context, if any.  For example, when identifying to
     services, ‘:user’ contains your current nickname.  Generalized
     parameter names, like ‘:user’ and ‘:host’, are always preferred
     over backend specific ones, like ‘:login’ or ‘:machine’.  In
     return, ERC expects a string if the search succeeds or ‘nil’ if it
     fails.

     The default value for all three options is the function
     ‘erc-auth-source-search’.  It tries to merge relevant contextual
     parameters with those provided or discovered from the logical
     connection or the underlying transport.

     For using auth-source along with SASL, *note SASL auth-source
     function::.

Channel keys
............

ERC also consults ‘auth-source’ to find “keys” that may be required by
certain channels you join.  When modifying a traditional ‘auth-source’
entry for this purpose, put the channel name in the ‘user’ field (for
example, ‘login "#fsf"’, in netrc’s case).  The actual key goes in the
‘password’ (or ‘secret’) field.

Troubleshooting
---------------

By default, ERC queries ‘auth-source’ for channel keys and server
passwords (*note auth-source Server Password::), as well as other,
module-specific credentials.  In general, if you’re having trouble
calling ‘auth-source-search’ in a custom query function, like
‘erc-auth-source-server-function’, try temporarily setting the variable
‘auth-source-debug’ to ‘t’ and checking ‘*Messages*’ periodically for
insights into how ‘auth-source’ is operating.

   If you’re using a GPG-encrypted file and find that customizing one of
the function-valued query options doesn’t solve your problem, explore
options ‘epg-pinentry-mode’ and ‘epg-debug’ in the ‘epg’ Custom group
(*note (epa)GnuPG Pinentry::).  Additionally, keep an eye out for an
‘*Error*’ buffer, which may contain more specific clues about your
situation.  If you use the libsecrets integration (*note (auth)Secret
Service API::) with something like GNOME Keyring, you may need to check
the “remember” box in the passphrase popup dialog to avoid being
prompted for confirmation every time you run ERC. If it doesn’t work at
first, try logging out.  And when in doubt, try using the Emacs command
‘secrets-show-secrets’ to browse the ‘Login’ keyring.  There should be a
‘GnuPG/stored-by’ entry with a value of ‘GnuPG Pinentry’ or similar.


File: docID5oTy.info,  Node: display-buffer,  Prev: auth-source,  Up: Integrations

5.4.4 display-buffer
--------------------

ERC supports the “action” interface used by ‘display-buffer’ and friends
from ‘window.el’.  *Note (elisp)Displaying Buffers::, for specifics.
When ERC displays a new or “reassociated” buffer, it consults its
various buffer-display options, such as ‘erc-buffer-display’, to decide
whether and how the buffer ought to appear in a window.  Exactly which
one it consults depends on the context in which the buffer is being
manifested.

   For some buffer-display options, the context is pretty cut and dry.
For instance, in the case of ‘erc-receive-query-display’, you’re
receiving a query from someone you haven’t yet chatted with in the
current session.  For other options, like ‘erc-interactive-display’, the
precise context varies.  For example, you might be opening a query
buffer with the command ‘/QUERY bob <RET>’ or joining a new channel with
‘/JOIN #chan <RET>’.  Power users wishing to distinguish between such
nuanced contexts or just exercise more control over buffer-display
behavior generally can elect to override these options by setting one or
more to a “‘display-buffer’-like” function that accepts a BUFFER and an
ACTION argument.

Examples
........

In this first example, a user-provided buffer-display function displays
new server buffers in the current window when issuing an ‘M-x erc-tls
<RET>’ and in a split window for all other interactve contexts covered
by the option ‘erc-interactive-display’, like clicking an ‘irc://’-style
URL (*note URL::).

     (defun my-erc-interactive-display-buffer (buffer action)
       "Pop to BUFFER when running \\[erc-tls], clicking a link, etc."
       (when-let ((alist (cdr action))
                  (found (alist-get 'erc-interactive-display alist)))
         (if (eq found 'erc-tls)
             (pop-to-buffer-same-window buffer action)
           (pop-to-buffer buffer action))))

     (setopt erc-interactive-display #'my-erc-interactive-display-buffer)

Observe that ERC supplies the names of buffer-display options as ACTION
alist keys and pairs them with contextual constants, like the symbols
‘erc-tls’ or ‘url’, the full lineup of which are listed below.

   In this second example, for Emacs 29 and above, the user writes three
predicates that somewhat resemble the “‘display-buffer’-like” function
above.  These too look for ACTION alist keys sharing the names of ERC’s
buffer-display options (and, in one case, a module’s minor mode).

     (defun my-erc-disp-entry-p (_ action)
       (memq (cdr (or (assq 'erc-buffer-display action)
                      (assq 'erc-interactive-display action)))
             '(erc-tls url)))

     (defun my-erc-disp-query-p (_ action)
       (or (eq (cdr (assq 'erc-interactive-display action)) '/QUERY)
           (and (eq (cdr (assq 'erc-receive-query-display action)) 'PRIVMSG)
                (member (erc-default-target) '("bob" "alice")))))

     (defun my-erc-disp-chan-p (_ action)
       (or (assq 'erc-autojoin-mode action)
           (and (eq (cdr (assq 'erc-buffer-display action)) 'JOIN)
                (member (erc-default-target) '("#emacs" "#fsf")))))

You’ll notice we ignore the BUFFER parameter of these predicates because
ERC ensures that BUFFER is already current (which is why we can freely
call ‘erc-default-target’).  Note also that we cheat a little by
treating the ACTION parameter like an alist when it’s really a cons of
one or more functions and an alist.

To complement our predicates, we set all three buffer-display options
referenced in their ACTION-alist lookups to ‘display-buffer’.  This
tells ERC to defer to that function in the display contexts covered by
these options.

     (setopt erc-buffer-display #'display-buffer
             erc-interactive-display #'display-buffer
             erc-receive-query-display #'display-buffer
             ;;
             erc-auto-reconnect-display 'bury)

The last option above just tells ERC to avoid any buffer-display
machinery when auto-reconnecting.  (For historical reasons, ERC’s
buffer-display options use the term “bury” to mean “ignore” rather than
‘bury-buffer’.)

   Finally, we compose our predicates into ‘buffer-match-p’ conditions
and pair them with various well known ‘display-buffer’ action functions
and action-alist members.

     (setopt display-buffer-alist

             ;; Create new frame with M-x erc-tls RET or (erc-tls ...)
             '(((and (major-mode . erc-mode) my-erc-disp-entry-p)
                display-buffer-pop-up-frame
                (reusable-frames . visible))

               ;; Show important chans and queries in a split.
               ((and (major-mode . erc-mode)
                     (or my-erc-disp-chan-p my-erc-disp-query-p))
                display-buffer-pop-up-window)

               ;; Ignore everything else.
               ((major-mode . erc-mode)
                display-buffer-no-window
                (allow-no-window . t))))

Of course, we could just as well set our buffer-display options to one
or more homespun functions instead of bothering with
‘display-buffer-alist’ at all (in what would make for a more complicated
version of our first example).  But perhaps we already have a growing
menagerie of similar predicates and like to keep everything in one place
in our ‘init.el’.

5.5 Options
===========

This section is extremely incomplete.  For now, the easiest way to check
out all the available options for ERC is to do ‘M-x customize-group
<RET> erc <RET>’.

 -- User Option: erc-hide-list
     If non, ‘nil’, this is a list of IRC message types to hide, e.g.:

          (setq erc-hide-list '("JOIN" "PART" "QUIT"))

 -- User Option: erc-network-hide-list
     If non, ‘nil’, this is a list of IRC networks and message types to
     hide, e.g.:

          (setq erc-network-hide-list (("Libera.Chat" "JOIN" "PART" "QUIT")
          ("OFTC" "JOIN" "PART""))

 -- User Option: erc-channel-hide-list
     If non, ‘nil’, this is a list of IRC channels and message types to
     hide, e.g.:

          (setq erc-channel-hide-list (("#erc" "JOIN" "PART" "QUIT")
          ("#emacs" "NICK"))

 -- User Option: erc-lurker-hide-list
     Like ‘erc-hide-list’, but only applies to messages sent by lurkers.
     The function ‘erc-lurker-p’ determines whether a given nickname is
     considered a lurker.

6 Getting Help and Reporting Bugs
*********************************

After you have read this guide, if you still have questions about ERC,
or if you have bugs to report, there are several places you can go.

   • <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ERC> is the emacswiki.org page for
     ERC.  Anyone may add tips, hints, etc. to it.  If you do so, please
     help keep it up to date.

   • You can ask questions about using ERC on the Emacs mailing list,
     <https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs>, as well as
     on ERC’s own low-volume list,
     <https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-erc>.

   • You can visit the IRC Libera.Chat channel ‘#emacs’.  Many of the
     contributors are frequently around and willing to answer your
     questions.  You can also try the relatively quiet ‘#erc’, on the
     same network, for more involved questions.

   • You can check GNU ELPA between Emacs releases to see if a newer
     version is available that might contain a fix for your issue:
     <https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/erc.html>.

     To upgrade, run ‘M-x list-packages <RET>’.  In the ‘*Packages*’
     (‘package-menu-mode’) buffer, click the ‘erc’ package link for the
     desired version.  If unsure, or if the version column is too narrow
     to tell, try the bottom-most candidate.  In the resulting
     ‘help-mode’ buffer, confirm the version and click ‘Install’.  Make
     sure to restart Emacs before reconnecting to IRC, and don’t forget
     that you can roll back to the previous version by running ‘M-x
     package-delete <RET>’.  *Note (emacs)Packages::, for more
     information.

     Note that a bug affecting Emacs’ packaging machinery may prevent
     the above method from working on Emacs versions 29 and below.
     Users on 29 can try running ‘C-u M-x package-install <RET>’
     instead.  Users on 28 and below can click on the _installed_ ‘erc’
     line item in the ‘*Packages*’ buffer instead of the newest one, and
     then, in the resulting ‘help-mode’ buffer, find and activate the
     button for the newest version, which should appear in the summary
     item ‘Other versions’.

     In the rare instance you need an emergency fix or have volunteered
     to test an edge feature between ERC releases, you can try adding
     ‘("devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/")’ to ‘package-archives’
     prior to performing the steps above.  For this, you’ll want to
     instead select a “snapshot” version from the menu.  Please be aware
     that when going this route, the latest changes may not yet be
     available and you run the risk of incurring other bugs and
     encountering unstable features.

   • To report a bug in ERC, use ‘M-x erc-bug’.

7 History
*********

ERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin.
They stopped development around December 1999.  Their last released
version was ERC 2.0.

   P.S.: If one of the original developers of ERC reads this, we’d like
to receive additional information for this file and hear comments in
general.

   • 2001

     In June 2001, Mario Lang and Alex Schroeder took over development
     and created a ERC Project at
     <https://sourceforge.net/projects/erc>.

     In reaction to a mail about the new ERC development effort, Sergey
     Berezin said, “First of all, I’m glad that my version of ERC is
     being used out there.  The thing is, I do not have free time and
     enough incentive anymore to work on ERC, so I would be happy if you
     guys take over the project entirely.”

     So we happily hacked away on ERC, and soon after (September 2001)
     released the next "stable" version, 2.1.

     Most of the development of the new ERC happened on ‘#emacs’ on
     irc.openprojects.net.  Over time, many people contributed code,
     ideas, bugfixes, and a lot of alpha/beta/gamma testing.

     See the ‘CREDITS’ file for a list of contributors.

   • 2003

     ERC 3.0 was released.

   • 2004

     ERC 4.0 was released.

   • 2005

     ERC 5.0 was released.  Michael Olson became the release manager and
     eventually the maintainer.

     After some discussion between him and the Emacs developers, it was
     decided to include ERC in Emacs.

   • 2006

     ERC 5.1 was released.  It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.

     ERC became an official GNU project, and development moved to
     <https://sv.gnu.org/projects/erc>.  We switched to using GNU Arch
     as our revision control system.  Our mailing list address changed
     as well.

   • 2007

     We switched to using git for our version control system.

   • 2009+

     Since about 2009, ERC is no longer developed as a separate project,
     but is maintained as part of Emacs.

Official IRC channels
---------------------

The official channels for GNU Emacs and ERC lived on the Freenode IRC
network until June 2021, when they—along with the official IRC channels
of the GNU Project, the Free Software Foundation, and many other free
software communities—relocated to the Libera.Chat network in the
aftermath of changes in governance and policies of Freenode in May and
June 2021.  GNU and FSF’s announcements about this are at
<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2021-06/msg00005.html>,
<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2021-06/msg00007.html>, and
<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu-emacs/2021-06/msg00000.html>.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
